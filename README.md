# Pro.JPA2 projects/examples recreated
 
This dir contains the examples from the **pro JPA2** book

The book exampes are in a strange format with custom scripts and tailored for glassfish.

Here I will rebukld them with maven, jboss and probably a jsf frontend if I will have enough time

As of now - 2012.08.28 - I have copied the jboss7.1 kitchensink example here, refactored it, replaced the jboss content and replaced logging with logback , or at least sjf

--> how to find yout which frame work is working under the hood?
